            <title><![CDATA[Novice Look: Brussels]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Novice Look: Brussels</h1><p>On our 11th Wedding Anniversary me and my wife decided to spend it in Belgium...The Novice Look project was born less than a month after i bought the camera(canon 70D)...It was a culmination of countless hours of fiddling with the said camera and pushing it to it's limits...A little R&R(reading and research) gave me a bare knowledge of my camera's pros and cons...It is not about using the camera for just a particular scene but how the scene make the most out of your camera...I divided this project into a two part series(Brussels and Brugge)...This shoot made the most out of the trip and for the first time there were people in it...Casting was not that difficult because i had a subject that was close to my heart..This trip reminded me of how lucky i am to have a loving and beautiful partner...my Best friend my WIFE...This was shot mostly on a 40mm canon prime lens 2.8(pancake lens) and the canon kit lens 18-135mm efs lens 3.5...Enjoy!!!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bb9307f14c657ed2b73313c29d2c5662888beced.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[On my 35th Birthday me and the bettehalf went up north of the border in Ireland to visit this lovely Estate...Castle Leslie was the first time i shot my Canon 70D handheld outdoors...The best part of this trip aside from having to watch my wife ride a horse for the first time in her life( which was a sight to see)... is that i got to play around with the camera settings a little bit and also enabled me to appreciate some important things when shooting outdoors...Image stabilization on lenses and cameras, Filters (polarizer and ND's etc.) and extra accessories like a simple tripod, monopod or even sliders if you have one...But on the contrary it is not about the gear all the time...remember less makes you think outside the BOX... ]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[My First shoot on my Canon 70D...A real eye opener in a sense that there is a lot to consider before hitting the Rec button...This is a lesson that every Ninja shooter should consider!!..But who cares about Camera settings because at the end of the day it is the learning experience that you gain that matters most!!!]]></title>
