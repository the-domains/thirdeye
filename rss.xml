            <title><![CDATA[Two months after i bought the Canon 70D an opportunity came about to shoot a special event…On that particular occasion i took the challenge to shoot a Christening…This is where i tested all the stuff that i learned for the past couple of months…The most important one is that Motion or Film is 50 percent STORY or CONTENT and 50 percent SOUND…In Film making Story is always the King…You could have all the best gear in the world to create beautiful and incredible shots…You could acquire all the skills, knowledge and techniques in making those shots… But sad to say without a good story to connect it to, you will fail in an epic proportion… A low budget Film shot on a smartphone with an awesome story would always stand out against a high budget Film shot with the most advance and modern cinema cameras but with a boring and crap storyline…Another important matter to take note is that Sound is as important as your content or story…The difference between amateur and professional films is that the latter has a very good sound quality so always remember that…I always say that this art form doesn’t have shortcuts and that it is all part of the pain staking process of learning…So another vital lesson is that COLLABORATION is an integral part of film making…Working with crews, writers and editors is part of the whole package…Although i did almost everything in this project i could have not pulled it off without the help and inputs shared by my wife…She even took the role as my second camera operator for B rolls…You see it is not advisable to do it all on your own…And lastly always prepare for the worse…In this film i really spent time with the planning, storyboard, surveying the site in advance, prepared my gear, rehearsed my shots and even shooting my B rolls in advance but still unexpected things still appeared on the actual shoot almost ruining this project…Always put in mind that anytime everything could go south so it wouldn’t hurt to be prepared…In this film I was able to purchase additional gear like an evf,slider,monopod and a decent tripod…Me and my wife used two more camera’s on this one…The samsung Galaxy camera and my iPhone 6…I also used my new 24-105 mm Canon L lens…This Film drained me in bits not to mention the stress of editing but it was fun and i honestly enjoyed it…The truth is an opportunity presented itself and gladly i was able to rise up and delivered pretty much a decent end result…ANYAG means beautiful in my native tongue…I will always remember this film as my ANYAG moment…It was a source of hope and certainly an inspiration not only for me but for everyone who gave the effort to make JIRO: A Christening Tale a successful one…Cheers!!!]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[This is the second part of the Belgium series…BRUGGE is a city located at the northern part of Belgium…A prominent city during the the peak of the FLANDER era in Europe…BRUGGE is like a little Venice because of it’s canals and historical structures…We really enjoyed our stay in this city…A small city but with loads of things to offer on the table…In this sequel i value the importance of shooting early in the morning and late in the afternoon…It gave you a lot of freedom and less obstacles when it comes to lighting…If there's one thing that can make or break a film more than any other, it's lighting… You might have the most incredible landscape or stunning portrait shot, but without the right quality of light you can still be left with a flat, dull, and uninspiring videos especially if your shooting outdoors…It is called the GOLDEN HOUR….The Golden hour, sometimes called the "magic hour", is roughly the first hour of light after sunrise, and the last hour of light before sunset… During these times the sun is low in the sky, producing a soft, diffused light which is much more flattering than the harsh midday sun that we are usually shooting on…This type of light produces less contrast, reducing the chances of losing parts of your subject in strong shadows or blown-out highlights. The warm glow adds a pleasing feel to the scene, and the long shadows help to pick out details, adding texture and depth to your clips…Mind you I’m still struggling to learn this…We definitely can’t move mountains but we certainly can climb it….There is always a learning curve for everything..The moment we stop learning is the moment we stop breathing…So remember in Life or Film Making it is always about savoring and enjoying the JOURNEY.]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[On our 11th year Wedding Anniversary...Me and my wife decided to celebrate and spend it in Belgium...This is where i started entertaining the idea of turning the Novice Look Project into a personal travel VLOG...It was created less than a month after i bought the camera to capture the elegance and stunning sceneries of it's two famous cities...This travel video was divided into a two part series BRUSSELS and BRUGGE...After endless hours of countless fiddling and experimenting with the camera i was able to gain an important wake - up call of some sort...A deep realization that it is not what the camera's strength that makes the big difference in film making but it's WEAKNESS!...Knowing your camera's limitation is essential in Filmmaking...So crucial for the sole reason that it gives you the drive to innovate and be more creative with your shots...Turning your camera's deficiency into an advantage takes a lot of motivation and sacrifice...But it is a tool that every film maker should have...The canon 70D has it's own share of pros and cons...It is not the perfect camera out there but certainly it is one of the best DSLR's to learn the craft...I shot everything handheld in this video using the kit lens which is the canon 18-135 mm EFS 3.5 and the canon 40 mm prime pancake lens 2.8...This is the first time that i used a prime lens and a variable ND Filter...ND stands for Neutral Density and it's a must have accessory in every shoot...Prime lenses are very good when you are just starting in film making...It makes you zoom in and out with your feet...Framing and compositing skills are being learned through the process of zooming with your feet...Thus making this film gave me a huge amount of knowledge... Things i did not know previously...This was also the first time that i had people as subjects and i did not go far to search for the person to portray the main character on this one...My gorgeous and ever supporting betterhalf... This video is so important and special because it reminds me that sometimes it is the simple things that matter...Like FAMILY...My wife is everything to me and this film made me appreciate her more...This made me realize how blessed i am to have her not only as my soulmate but as my Best Friend...]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[On my 35th Birthday me and the bettehalf went up north of the border in Ireland to visit this lovely Estate...Castle Leslie was the first time i shot my Canon 70D handheld outdoors...The best part of this trip aside from having to watch my wife ride a horse for the first time in her life( which was a sight to see)... is that i got to play around with the camera settings a little bit and also enabled me to appreciate some important things when shooting outdoors...Image stabilization on lenses and cameras, Filters (polarizer and ND's etc.) and extra accessories like a simple tripod, monopod or even sliders if you have one...But on the contrary it is not about the gear all the time...remember less makes you think outside the BOX... ]]></title>
