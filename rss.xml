            <title><![CDATA[On my 35th Birthday me and the bettehalf went up north of the border in Ireland to visit this lovely Estate...Castle Leslie was the first time i shot my Canon 70D handheld outdoors...The best part of this trip aside from having to watch my wife ride a horse for the first time in her life( which was a sight to see)... is that i got to play around with the camera settings a little bit and also enabled me to appreciate some important things when shooting outdoors...Image stabilization on lenses and cameras, Filters (polarizer and ND's etc.) and extra accessories like a simple tripod, monopod or even sliders if you have one...But on the contrary it is not about the gear all the time...remember less makes you think outside the BOX... ]]></title>
