opportunity came about to shoot a special event…On that particular occasion i took the challenge to shoot a Christening…This is where i tested all the stuff that i learned for the past couple of months…The most important one is that Motion or Film is 50 percent STORY or CONTENT and 50 percent SOUND…In Film making Story is always the King…You could have all the best gear in the world to create beautiful and incredible shots…You could acquire all the skills, knowledge and techniques in making those shots… But sad to say without a good story to connect it to, you will fail in an epic proportion… A low budget Film shot on a smartphone with an awesome story would always stand out against a high budget Film shot with the most advance and modern cinema cameras but with a boring and crap storyline….Another important matter to take note is that Sound is as important as your content or story…The difference between amateur and professional films is that the latter has a very good sound quality so always remember that…I always say that this art form doesn’t have shortcuts and that it is all part of the pain staking process of learning…So another vital lesson is that COLLABORATION is an integral part of film making…Working with crews, writers and editors is part of the whole package…Although i did almost everything in this project i could have not pulled it off without the help and inputs shared by my wife…She even took the role as my second camera operator for B rolls….You see it is not advisable to do it all on your own…And lastly always prepare for the worse…In this film i really spent time with the planning, storyboard, surveying the site in advance, prepared my gear, rehearsed my shots and even shooting my B rolls in advance but still unexpected things still appeared on the actual shoot almost ruining this project….Always put in mind that anytime everything could go south so it wouldn’t hurt to be prepared…In this film I was able to purchase additional gear like an evf,slider,monopod and a decent tripod….Me and my wife used two more camera’s on this one…The samsung Galaxy camera and my iPhone 6…I also used my new 24-105 mm Canon L lens…This Film drained me in bits not to mention the stress of editing but it was fun and i honestly enjoyed it…The truth is an opportunity presented itself and gladly i was able to rise up and delivered pretty much a decent end result…ANYAG means beautiful in my native tongue…I will always remember this film as my ANYAG moment…It was a source of hope and certainly an inspiration not only for me but for everyone who gave the effort to make JIRO: A Christening Tale a successful one…Cheers!!!</h1><iframe
