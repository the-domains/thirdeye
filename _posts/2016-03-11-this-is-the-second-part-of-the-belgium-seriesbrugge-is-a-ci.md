title: "This is the second part of the Belgium series…BRUGGE is a city located at the northern part of Belgium…A prominent city during the the peak of the FLANDER era in Europe…BRUGGE is like a little Venice because of it’s canals and historical structures…We really enjoyed our stay in this city…A small city but with loads of things to offer on the table…In this sequel i value the importance of shooting early in the morning and late in the afternoon…It gave you a lot of freedom and less obstacles when it comes to lighting…If there's one thing that can make or break a film more than any other, it's lighting… You might have the most incredible landscape or stunning portrait shot, but without the right quality of light you can still be left with a flat, dull, and uninspiring videos especially if your shooting outdoors…It is called the GOLDEN HOUR…The Golden hour, sometimes called the \"magic hour\", is roughly the first hour of light after sunrise, and the last hour of light before sunset… During these times the sun is low in the sky, producing a soft, diffused light which is much more flattering than the harsh midday sun that we are usually shooting on…This type of light produces less contrast, reducing the chances of losing parts of your subject in strong shadows or blown-out highlights. The warm glow adds a pleasing feel to the scene, and the long shadows help to pick out details, adding texture and depth to your clips…Mind you I’m still struggling to learn this…we definitely can’t move mountains but we certainly can climb it…There is always a learning curve for everything..The moment we stop learning is the moment we stop breathing…So remember in Life or Film Making it is always about savoring and enjoying the JOURNEY."

# This is the second part of the Belgium series...BRUGGE is a city located at the northern part of Belgium...A prominent city during the the peak of the FLANDER era in Europe...BRUGGE is like a little Venice because of it's canals and historical structures...We really enjoyed our stay in this city...A small city but with loads of things to offer on the table...In this sequel i value the importance of shooting early in the morning and late in the afternoon...It gave you a lot of freedom and less obstacles when it comes to lighting...If there's one thing that can make or break a film more than any other, it's lighting... You might have the most incredible landscape or stunning portrait shot, but without the right quality of light you can still be left with a flat, dull, and uninspiring videos especially if your shooting outdoors...It is called the GOLDEN HOUR...The Golden hour, sometimes called the "magic hour", is roughly the first hour of light after sunrise, and the last hour of light before sunset... During these times the sun is low in the sky, producing a soft, diffused light which is much more flattering than the harsh midday sun that we are usually shooting on...This type of light produces less contrast, reducing the chances of losing parts of your subject in strong shadows or blown-out highlights.
