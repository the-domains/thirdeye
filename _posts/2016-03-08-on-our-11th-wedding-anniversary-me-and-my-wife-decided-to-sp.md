title: "On our 11th Wedding Anniversary me and my wife decided to spend it in Belgium...The Novice Look project was born less than a month after i bought the camera(canon 70D)...It was a culmination of countless hours of fiddling with the said camera and pushing it to it's limits...A little R&R(reading and research) gave me a bare knowledge of my camera's pros and cons...It is not about using the camera for just a particular scene but how the scene make the most out of your camera...I divided this project into a two part series(Brussels and Brugge)...This shoot made the most out of the trip and for the first time there were people in it...Casting was not that difficult because i had a subject that was close to my heart..This trip reminded me of how lucky i am to have a loving and beautiful partner...my Best friend my WIFE...This was shot mostly on a 40mm canon prime lens 2.8(pancake lens) and the canon kit lens 18-135mm efs lens 3.5...Enjoy!!!"
